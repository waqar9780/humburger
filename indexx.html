            which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. 
            Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 
            2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">  In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for males
             and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for 
             male and 70.3% for female.[8] This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. 
             In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.[9] India's improved education system is often cited as one of the
              main contributors to its economic development.[10] Much of the progress, especially in higher education
               and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined 
            legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made 
            education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal 
            responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 
            28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in 
            the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically,
